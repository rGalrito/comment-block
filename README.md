# Comment-Block

This is an Atom package to help programmers to comment their code. There are plenty of packages similar to this one. I just did it for the sake of doing it.

## Installation

- Open Atom
- Package Manager > Install Package
- comment-block
- install
- restart (ctrl+alt+r)

## Usage

Whether you select on line, or multiple, you only need a shortcut: Ctrl + F3

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
